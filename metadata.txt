short description: The database of phrases connected with Unix-like operating systems.
description: This database has been created for students of Computer Science. No
    knowledge is required, but some basics about 'how a computer works'. To present
    the level of required knowledge: if you hear the word 'threads' and you think
    about either a cat that has some fun or a needle, then this course is probably
    not for you.
